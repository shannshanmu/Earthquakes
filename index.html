          <u>Earthquakes</u>
        </h1>

        <p>
          The ground shakes and rumbles,buildings topple over and the earth heaves and cracks,causing massive disasters and depriving
          many people of their homes.Powerful earthquakes are terrifying and dangerous,but are generally rare.
          <strong>But why do earthquakes happen?</strong>
          The earth is made up of four main layers–the inner core,outer core,mantle and lithosphere.The crust,part of the lithosphere,is
          a thin skin compared to the other layers.
        </p>

        <h1>
          <u>Earth's layers</u>
        </h1>
        <p>The order from outside to inside</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The lithosphere is around 150 km thick.It is divided into 2 parts:the crust and the upper mantle. The crust is
            also divided into 2 parts:the oceanic crust and the continental crust. The oceanic crust is
            <em>only about 6-11 km</em> thick whereas the continental crust is about 25-90 km thick. We could safely say the
            average thickness of the crust is approximately 40 km.</li>
          <li>The mantle,which is 2,600 km thick,is comprised of 3 parts:the upper,middle and lower mantle.They are respectively
            110 km,500 km and 2,050 km thick.</li>
          <li>Between the mantle and the outer core is a region known as Gutenberg Discontinuity,which is 190 km thick.</li>
          <li>The outer core is a massive 2,260 km thick</li>
          <li>The inner core is approximately 1,228 km thick</li>
        </ol>

        </figure>
        <p>
          This thin skin is broken into pieces called tectonic plates. The plates are all closely put together,some overlapping, floating
          on top of the Earth’s inner core. Sometimes the pieces slide under or against each other and become stuck. The
          place where this happens is called the fault or the fault plane. The hypocenter is the place under the earth,where
          the fault is and the epicenter is the hypocenter except that it is on the surface of the Earth. When they move
          again,the tremendous force created cause earthquakes. Over 80% of the Earth's earthquakes happen in the Pacific
          Ocean,in a region called the "Ring of Fire". Most of the deaths happen when people are crushed under falling buidings.

          <u>Predicting Earthquakes</u>
        </h1>
        <p>
          People called seismologists use seismographs to monitor for earthquakes. The product of the seismograph is called a seismogram.
          They can only give a
          <strong>very short warning</strong> (15 secs-5 mins) before the actual earthquake happens. Therefore, predicting when an earthquake is about to happen is not possible.

          <u>What you should do in the event of an earthquake</u>
        </h1>

        <h2>Indoors</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Get under-and hold onto-a desk or table, or huddle up in a corner of the room that you are in.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay clear of exterior walls, glass, heavy furniture, fireplaces and appliances.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>The kitchen is a particularly dangerous spot.</li>
          <li>I probably don't have to tell you not to use the elevator,if you are in a place that has one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outdoors</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Do not stray far from where you are.</li>
          <li>Move away from buidings,streetlights and utility wires.</li>
          <li>An open field with no big structures is the best spot.</li>
          <li>Once out in the open,stay there until the shaking stops.</li>
          <li>The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings,at exits and along exterior walls.</li>
        </ul>
